    "### Insight and analysis of my past and current reading behavior\n",

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a collection of works designed to shed light on my past reading behavior and habits. I have been recording the books I read since late 2015 with Goodreads.com. The website allows users to export their \"read\" shelf, which was teh first step in this project. In December 2017, after starting this project, I carefully reassessed my rating of each book and readjusted the ratings to reflect better how that book fits into the grand scheme of the things I read.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a beginner's attempt at analysis thoroughly augmented by statistics and machine learning. It is still a work in progress and constructive feedback is welcomed warmly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is motivated by two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What have I enjoyed reading? What haven't I enjoyed?\n",
    "2. What will ensure the next book I read is one I like?\n",
    "\n",
    "I foresee these goals being met by extensively defining what I have read, organizing those findings in a way that a machine could interpret them, and then allowing a machine to uncover latent patterns not easily seen at a glance.\n",
